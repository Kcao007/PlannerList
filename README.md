A Smart Task Management and Schedule Suggestion Mobile Platform for Efficiency Improvement using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Task management is a dilemma many people are plagued with in their daily lives. Ironically, this itself is a massive task for many, especially if they suffer from depression or other mental illnesses. In developing this app, we used ChatGPT 3.5-Turbo to receive a list of tasks from a user and return a completed schedule for them to follow. It contains a scheduling system that receives a token from the user and returns a token of its own in the form of JSON data that the program then parses and displays, a cloud storage that stores every userâ€™s data individually and can be drawn on easily, and a tasks page where users may create new tasks and complete old ones with three different display settings relating to the range of time the tasks are in: Today, Week, and All. This application will enable users to save time by crafting a schedule for them, help improve the time management skills of users, and help them finish goals before a set deadline.
